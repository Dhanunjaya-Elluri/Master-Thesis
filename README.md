## Time series forecasting on codewords generated by Kernel SAX using Transformers (Work in progress)

This repository contains an implementation of a time series forecasting model using Transformers. The model leverages the power of Transformer architecture to capture temporal dependencies and make accurate predictions on time series data. The input for the Transformers is generated using Kernel SAX, which incorporates Piecewise Aggregate Analysis (PAA) and Kmeans++ for codeword initialization. Additionally, the Lloyd Max Quantizer is utilized to optimize the codewords.
